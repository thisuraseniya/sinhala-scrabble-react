Sinhala Scrabble 

Created with React and Firebase, Sinhala Scrabble is a real-time online multiplayer scrabble in Sinhala language. 
Firebase Realtime Database is used to sync player states and the scrabble board between the players and for future work there is an idea to create a leaderboard using Firestore. 
This will make use of the authentication details currently in the project.
